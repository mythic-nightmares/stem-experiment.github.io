        <h3> Supplies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pipe cleaners</li>
            <li>fishing line (twine or yarn can work too)</li>
            <li>pencil or wooden scewer</li>
            <li>scissors</li>
            <li>glasses or plastics containers (one for each color)</li>
            <li>borax</li>
            <li>food coloring</li>
            <li>liquid measuring cup</li>
            <li>tablespoon</li>
            <li>heat safe mixing bowl</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the pipe cleaners to form the letters of your name, the name has to be able to fit into the containers without touching the sides.
            Older kids can do their full name in cursive as a challenge.
        </li>
        <li>Once the pipe cleaners are formed into the names, use the fishing line/twine/yarn and scewer to suspend the name in the jar.
            In order to suspend the name wrap the yarn around the pipe cleaner and on the mild of the wooden scewer to test if it would fit.
        </li>
        <li>Heat up a lot pot of water and then pour it into the jars for each color.</li>
        <li>For every cup of hot water, put 3 tablespoons of borax.</li>
        <li>Mix and wait for the borax to dissolve in the hot water before adding the food coloring.</li>
        <li>Carefully lower each letter/name into the container and then leave it to soak in the mixture overnight.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Science</h3>
    <p> &emsp; When borax is dissolved in water a suspension is created. A suspension is a mixture that has solid particles (the borax) that are large enough for sedimentation (settling out).
    As the borax begins to settle, it starts to crystalize on all the surfaces it comes in contact with, including the pipe cleaner letters.
    As the borax continues to settle out, it builds crystals on top of other borax crystals creating a thick layer.</p>
