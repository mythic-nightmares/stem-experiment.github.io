        <h3> Supplies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups of white vinegar (acetic acid)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)</li>
            <li>A pot</li>
            <li>A glass measuring cup or mason jar (make sure itâ€™s heat safe glass)</li>
            <li>A dish</li>
            <li>A spoon</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 4 cups of vinegar into a medium-sized pot.</li>
        <li>Add 4 tablespoons of baking soda to the pot. (Note: The key is to add the baking soda slowly so it doesn't bubble over.)</li>
        <li>Stir until the baking soda dissolved and stopped fizzing.</li>
        <li>Slowly boil the solution over medium-low heat for a little over an hour to remove the extra water.</li>
        <li>The solution reduces by about 75% so there will be about 3/4 cup. White powdery crystals will form on the sides of the pot near the top of the solution. (Note: If you boil your solution at a higher temperature it may turn yellow-brownish, but the experiment will still work.) </li>
        <li>Pour the concentrated sodium acetate into a glass measuring cup and place it in the fridge to cool. (Note: You can scraped the little bits of dried solution powder off the inside of the pot to use later.)</li>
        <li>After about 30-45 minutes, the solution will be cool enough to turn into ice.</li>
        <li>Grab the glass dish and place a small pile of the sodium acetate powder from the pot in the center. This will act as a seed for the crystals to start forming.</li>
        <li>Carefully take the cooled solution out of the fridge because any bump could start the crystallizing process.</li>
        <li>Pour the solution very slowly into the pan and crystals will begin to instantly form.</li>    
    </ol>
    <p> You can use food coloring to make the ice colorful.</p>

    <h3>The Science</h3>
    <p> &emsp; The sodium acetate solution in the refrigerator is what is called a supercooled liquid.  
        That means the sodium acetate is in liquid form below its usual melting point. Once you touch, bump, or add a small crystal that is not liquid, crystallization will begin and the liquid will change to a solid.
        When the molecules in the solute (sodium acetate) are in a solution, they normally are surrounded by a solvent (in this case water molecules).</p>
