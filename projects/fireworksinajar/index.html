    <div class="content-box">
        <h3> Supplies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Warm water</li>
            <li>Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>Food coloring</li>
            <li>A fork</li>
            <li>Clear jar or container</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill your jar 3/4 of the way full with warm water.</li>
        <li>In a separate, mix a 3-4 tablespoons of oil and several drops of different colors of food coloring</li>
        <li>Use a fork to gently mix the oil and food coloring together.</li>
        <li>Gently pour the oil mixture into the jar.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The food coloring will slowly sink out of the oil and into the water. When this happens, it will expand and begin to mix with the other colors.</p>

    <h3>The Science</h3>
    <p> &emsp; Food coloring dissolves in water but not in oil. Because the oil is less dense than the water, it will float at the top. 
        The colored droplets will begin to sink because they are heavier than the oil. 
        Once they sink into the water, they will begin dissolving into the water (which looks like a tiny explosion).</p>
