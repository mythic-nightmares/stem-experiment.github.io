        <h3> Supplies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7 craft sticks (jumbo-sized works best but regular sticks will do too)</li>
            <li>4 rubber bands</li>
            <li>A small lid</li>
            <li>Hot glue gun</li>
            <li>Small candies (like skittles and starbursts)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Count out 5 sticks, stack them on top of eachother and bind the ends tightly with a rubber band.</li>
        <li>Put the other two sits on the top and bottom of the stick bundle and wrap a rubber band around the end where the two sticks meet and around where the two sticks touched the bundle.</li>
        <li>Use the hot glue gun to glue the lid to the lifted end of one of the two sticks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Science</h3>
    <p> &emsp; The popsicle stick catapult is a simple machine, a mechanical device used to change the direction or magnitude of a force.  The catapult is an example of a lever type simple machine in which a beam or arm pivots at a fixed point called the fulcrum.
        In the catapult, you press down on the arm.  Therefore, tension builds and energy is stored.
        Energy that is stored when a material is compressed (think of a spring) or stretched (a slingshot) is called elastic energy.  When you release the arm of the catapult, the elastic energy is converts into kinetic energy, the energy of motion. When you place an object like the small candies in the bucket, the candies moves at the same speed as the arm and the bucket.
        When the arm stops, the candy projectile continues to move forward due to Newtonâ€™s first law, which states that an object in motion, stays in motion. As a result, the candy becomes airborne.
        Gravity pulls the candy back toward the ground, giving its trajectory, or path.</p>
