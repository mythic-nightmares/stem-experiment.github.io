        <h3> Supplies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tall glass vase or a large bowl</li>
            <li>Two Oranges</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour water into the vase or bowl until it is about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Then place one orange into the water. (The orange should infact float.)</li>
        <li>Then with the second orange, peel off the skin. (The orange will sink.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Science</h3>
    <p> &emsp;Why is it that a peeled orange sinks even though it is lighter than an unpeeled orange?  The secret lies in its peel!
        Buoyancy is the tendency of an object to float or sink in water or any other fluid.
        Whether an object is buoyant is determined by Archimedesâ€™ Principle which states that any object in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
        When the orange is placed in water, there are two forces working on it in opposite directions: gravitational force pulls the orange down while buoyant force pushes it up.
        Gravity pulls the orange down with a force equal to the weight of the orange, while buoyant force pushes the orange upward with a force equal to the weight of the water that the orange displaced.
        If the orange can displace a volume of water that equals (or is greater than) the weight of the orange, then it will be buoyant and float.
        While making the orange weigh slightly more, the peel of an orange helps displace enough water to make the unpeeled orange buoyant.
        The peel is also full of tiny pockets of air that make the unpeeled orange less dense than water, and the orange floats.
        When you remove the peel, the orange no longer displaces enough water to overcome gravitational force. The orange becomes more dense than water and it sinks. </p>
