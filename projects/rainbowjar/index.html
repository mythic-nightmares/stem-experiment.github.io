        <h3> Supplies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A tall clear container</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Light corn syrup</li>
            <li>Dish Soap (either blue like dawn or green like Palmolive)</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Food coloring</li>
            <li>A dropper</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour honey in the center of the jar, don't let it touch the sides of the jar.</li>
        <li>Pour in the corn syrup and add purple food coloring.</li>
        <li>Pour in the dish soap.</li>
        <li>Pour in regular water, you can color it blue but if your dish soap is blue you can color it a different color.</li>
        <li>Pour in olive oil (Note: Pour a fairly thick layer of oil, it will come in handy for the next step.)</li>
        <li>Next is the rubbing alcohol, add red food coloring. However before you pour it in the middle of the jar like all the others you have to use the dropper. The key is to not breaking through the oil layer.</li> 
    </ol>

    <h3>The Science</h3>
    <p> &emsp; Density is the mass of an object divided by its volume. It can also be used as a conversion factor between mass and volume.
        Different liquids have different weights and thus different densities because some liquids have more molecules than others.
        This will cause some of the liquids to sink and some to rise and make a rainbow jar.</p>
