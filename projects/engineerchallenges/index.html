    <h3>The Science</h3>
    <p> &emsp; For clouds to form they need 3 things; water, cool air, and condensation nuclei.
        Water vapor evaporates from the surface water.  As it rises, the air cools.  The cooler air higher in the atmosphere cannot hold as much water vapor as the warmer air near the surface of the earth.
        Some of the water vapor wants to condense, but in order to change from a gas to a liquid, water needs a non-gaseous surface.  Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) or cloud seeds provide that surface.  CCNâ€™s can be any tiny solid or liquid found in the atmosphere, usually salt from the ocean, dust, or pollution.
        In this demonstration you added water vapor to the jar by using warm water.  The smoke or hairspray acted as the cloud seed.  When you added the ice filled lid on top you cooled the warm air causing it to condense on the the surface of the cloud seed particles, forming a cloud.
